# Introduction 


Investigate if summer NAO (sNAO) has an effect on body mass of *Ovis aries* and determine other factors.

## Hypothesis 

* Null - The sNAO has no effect on body mass within the population.
* Alternative - NAO and sNAO determines weight within the population.

## Visualisations


```{r EDA visuals}

# Group NAO by year 
grouped_NAO <- nao_data %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_NAO = mean(NAO))

ggplot(grouped_NAO, aes(y = mean_NAO, x = year )) +
  geom_line(col = "lightgrey") +
  geom_point(col = "darkorchid3") +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("difference in mean NAO (hPa)") +
  ggtitle("Yearly NAO difference")
  

```
**Figure 1.** Yearly mean NAO difference -
  The figure, indicates that there is a clear positive relationship between NAO and year.There is a high level of fluctuation indicated by    the peaks and troughs.


```{R summer check}

ggplot(nao_data, aes(y = NAO, x = year, col = month)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Yearly NAO difference by month")




```

**Figure 2.** Yearly NAO difference by month
There is a clear pattern of NAO pressure being much more variable in June, July and august.



```{r EDA jitter}

#analysis of NAO data points by month

#converts month character so it can be ordered.
nao_data$month = factor(nao_data$month,levels = month.name)

# NAO difference by month - boxplot and   jitter
ggplot(nao_data, aes(y = NAO, 
                     x = factor(nao_data$month,levels = month.name), fill = month)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.3, outlier.shape=NA) +
  geom_point(position=position_jitterdodge()) +
  theme_classic() +
  ylab("difference NAO (hPa)") +
  xlab("Month") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        ) +
  ggtitle("Monthly NAO difference")
  
  

```

**Figure 3.** Monthly NAO difference  -
This shows that NAO has much more variation within the months of June-August.


## Mass data analysis

### Check NAs


```{r missing values, warning=FALSE}

#check for NA values and present results in a table

knitr::kable(mass_data %>%
  dplyr::select(everything()) %>%  #select all columns
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)),n = n())) %>% #apply to all columns
  dplyr::select(c(1:9))) # only show 1 sample total

knitr::kable(nao_data %>%
  dplyr::select(everything()) %>%  #select all columns
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)),n = n())) %>% #apply to all columns
   dplyr::select(c(1:4)))# only show 1 sample total

```


```{r}
#remove_NAs
mass_data_clean <- mass_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(weight))  #remove NAs

```


```{r weight histogram}
# check for normal distribution of data of our response variable
ggplot(mass_data_clean, aes(x = weight, alpha=after_stat(count))) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkolivegreen4", binwidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

**Figure 4.** Distribution of weight difference -
This figure shows how weight difference has a central tendency towards 1kg.

```{r weight qqplot, warning=FALSE}

ggqqplot(mass_data_clean, x = "weight", color = "dodgerblue4") + theme_classic()

```

**Figure 5.** Weight qqplot  -
At the extreme ends weight data does not fit very well to a normal distribution, it is lightly tailed.





```{r}

#weight and sex
ggplot(mass_data_clean, aes(x= sex, y = weight, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest1"))+
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest1"))

```

**Figure 7. ** Sex and weight difference  -
The difference in mean weight between the male and female groups.

```{r}
#weight, n_babies, facet by sex
ggplot(mass_data_clean, aes(x = as.factor(n_babies), y = weight, fill = as.factor(n_babies))) + 
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.2, fill = "white") +
  facet_grid(~ sex) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Zissou1"))+
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("Zissou1")) +
  xlab(" Number of babies") +
  stat_summary( fun = mean, geom="point") +
  theme(legend.position="none")

```

**Figure 8. ** Number of babies and weight difference  -
The number of babies does not influence a difference in weight.


``` {R weight, year and age}

#weight, age and year
ggplot(mass_data_clean, aes(x= year, y = weight, col = age)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_classic()
  #scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest1"))+
  #scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("GrandBudapest1"))

```
Figure 9 - Weight by Year and Age
The plot shows that older sheep generally have higher weight.

``` {R sex and age}
ggplot(mass_data_clean, aes(x= sex, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()


#weight, age 
ggplot(mass_data_clean, aes(x= age, y = weight, col = age)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_classic()

```



* **Summary** - Sex , age and year are interesting variables.





# Data transformation

The mass data needs to be joined to the NAO data by the year column.



```{r}


# Join yearly mass to yearly NAO data.
mass_NAO_df <- dplyr::left_join(mass_data_clean, nao_data,
                                     by = c("year"= "year"))
#view the transformation
knitr::kable(head(mass_NAO_df))

```
 

```{R transform to sNAO category}

#### lets try to create a summer categorical variable to group by ###
## 28/12/2022

#filter for the summer months with increased NAO variation
summer_filter <- c("June", "July", "August")

### creating a category of sNAO and not sNAO for visualisaton
mass_NAO_df <- mass_NAO_df %>%
  mutate(nao_type = case_when(month %in% summer_filter ~ "summer_NAO", #in summer
                              !month %in% summer_filter ~ "not_summer_NAO"))#not in summer

knitr::kable(head(mass_NAO_df))

```



## Data Visualisation
Data visualation after the join.

```{r point mean weight & mean NAO}
#point data
ggplot(data = mass_NAO_df, 
       aes(x = NAO , y = weight, colour = nao_type )) + 
  geom_point() + theme_classic()

```

**Figure 10 ** weight by summer NAO
A view of the data after joining Mass and NAO data via year show clustering of non-summer months.



# Generalised linear models (GLMs)

Examine casual relationships using GLMs.

* Variables of interest.
  + sex
  + NAO
  + year
  + age
  + month
  


## Deciding distributions


```{r fitdist }

#check oberserved weigth differences, against the normal distribution.
plot(fitdist(mass_NAO_df$weight, "norm"))


#summary statistics, skewness is low.
descdist(mass_NAO_df$weight, boot = 1000)

```

**Figure 11.** Fitdist the normal distribution -
The normal distribution can be used in the model,there are negative values which limit other families.



## Creating Models 

```{R GLM creating models }
# weight - predictors - NAO
mod1 <- glm(weight ~ NAO,
            data = mass_NAO_df,
            family = "gaussian")

# weight - predictors - NAO + sex 
mod2 <-  glm(weight ~ NAO + sex,
            data = mass_NAO_df,
            family = "gaussian")

# weight - predictors - NAO + sex 
mod3 <-  glm(weight ~ NAO + sex + age,
            data = mass_NAO_df,
            family = "gaussian") 


# weight - predictors - NAO + sex 
mod4 <-  glm(weight ~ NAO + sex + age * year,
            data = mass_NAO_df,
            family = "gaussian")


# null model for comparison
null_mod <- glm(weight ~ 1,
            data = mass_NAO_df,
            family = "gaussian")

        
```

## Assessing Model fit

```{R Comparing models}

# The performance package can compare models
compare_performance(mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4) %>% kable()

compare_performance(mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, rank = TRUE) %>% kable()

```


**Table 1.** - A summary of GLM model formulas and ranking.
Model 3 and 4 are the best performing models.



```{r visual model performance}

plot(compare_performance(mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4))

```

**Figure 12.** Model Ranking -
A visual representation of model ranking, while a clear lowest AIC value has been determined in model 3, model 6 shows promising interactions of nao type variable and sex.


```{r heteroscedasticity }
#Checking for heteroscedasticity
check_heteroscedasticity(mod1)
check_heteroscedasticity(mod2)
check_heteroscedasticity(mod3)
check_heteroscedasticity(mod4)

```


## Model output

```{r model outputs 4}

summary(mod3)
summary(mod4)

```


Model 3 and 4 do have significant p-values for sex and age predictor variables.


```{r annova as model }

# comparing deviance of models by order of ranking.

anova(mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, test = "Chisq")

```





```{r null model }

# lets also compare predictors against a null model
anova(mod4, null_mod, test= "Chisq")
```





```{r model 4.1}
# computes a statistically significant p-value for chi-squared and formats the output better.
summ(mod4, confint = TRUE)

```

```{r}

export_summs(mod4)

```



## Predicted vs observed


```{r}


#Lets compare predicted vs observed values from some promising models.


#model 3
##visualize the fitted vs observed values for model 3 
fit_data4 <- data.frame("predicted"= mod4$fitted.values,
                       "observed" = mass_NAO_df$weight)
##plot them
po1 <- ggplot(fit_data4, aes(x=observed, y=predicted)) + 
  geom_point(col = "lightgreen") + 
  ##add a 1:1 line

  theme(legend.position="none") +
  ggtitle("a) Model 3")



#model 3.2 without interactions

              col="lightblue",
              se = F) +
  #colour adjustment
  ##set the theme
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position="none" ) +
  ggtitle("b) Model 4") +
  theme(axis.title.y =element_blank()) # remove dup axis




grid.arrange(po1,po2, nrow = 1)



```


**Figure 13.** Predicted vs observed weight values -


## visualising the models

The check models package can be used to visualise model performance.

```{r check model 3}

check_model(mod3)

```

**Figure 14.** Performance package visualisation of model 3 -
This visualization shows that the observed data fit relatively well to the model prediction.
The error residuals fit a normal distribution via the qqplot but does tail off at the extremes.
However, the model is presenting heteroscedasticity which is due to large variation in the dependent variable.


```{r check model 4}

check_model(mod4)

```


# GLM Discussion

To conclude, clustering has been detected between the weight and NAO variables in non-summer months, with the summer months having much more varied weight (Figure 10). Sex and age are predictors of weight with males presenting a decrease in weight response variable(Figure 7). 

The GLM analysis confirms that model 3 is the best performing. However, there is Heteroscedasticity occuring in this model. 

There is evidence to reject the null hypothesis and claim that NAO is a variable that is linked to weight difference in *Oves ares*.


Further analysis using GLMMs is required to examine random effects of year and age.


# GLMM Analysis


# Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs)

It is likely that there are other variables effecting the relationship between weight and NAO which have not been considered in our model.These random effect can be analysed using Genralised lineaer mixed-effect models.


We need to think about the data structure and if there are any hierarchical structures in the dataset.

## EDA for GLMMs

```{R}

# unique individuals
length(unique(mass_NAO_df$ID))

ggplot(mass_data_clean %>% group_by(ID) %>% summarise(sum_of_count = n_distinct(year)), 
       aes(y = sum_of_count, x = ID)) + geom_point()

  
  
```
Figure 15
There are 908 unique individuals that have had multiple observations overtime.
The figure above shows there is variance in the amount of observations per person.

#### Random intercepts  #####


# weight - predictors - NAO + sex (best performing)
mod3 <-  glm(weight ~ NAO + sex + age,
            data = mass_NAO_df,
            family = "gaussian") 


#site as a random effect
m_mod1 <- glmmTMB(weight ~ NAO + sex + age +
                    (1|site), #random intercept effects
                  data=mass_NAO_df,
                  family="gaussian")


#site as a random effect

  ylab("Predicted")

```
Figure 17 - Predicted vs observed values for the best performing model 2.
The final visual check shows the model 2 fits reasonable well but there is some under and over prediction.

## GLMM conclusion

Model 2 introduces a random intercept for the "ID" grouping variable, and it demonstrates a good fit to the data with low AIC and BIC values. The model provides a dispersion estimate of 18.4 for the Gaussian family, indicating reasonably consistent variation in the response variable.

In terms of fixed effects, "sex" and "age" are highly significant predictors of "weight," with "sex" showing a strong negative effect, while "NAO" does not appear to significantly impact the response.

Overall, Model 2 is a robust and appropriate choice, capturing individual variation at the "ID" level and revealing the significant impact of sex and age on weight.

This model provides evidence to accept the null hypothesis that summer NAO has no impact on body weight.
